# Road Accident Data Analysis (UK)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of UK road traffic accidents using a dataset of **307,973 records** from official sources.

## Project Overview

This project analyzes patterns in road accidents to identify high-risk conditions, seasonal trends, weather/road surface impacts, time-of-day effects, accident severity distribution, and contributing factors.

**Main goals:**
- Understand seasonal, weekly, and daily accident patterns
- Investigate relationships between weather, road conditions, speed limit, urban/rural area, and severity
- Visualize key insights using charts and heatmaps

## Dataset

- **Source**: Official UK road accident data (commonly used public dataset)
- **Size**: 307,973 rows × 21 columns
- **Time period**: Multi-year (exact years visible in visualizations)
- **Key columns**:
  - Accident_Index
  - Accident Date / Day of Week
  - Accident Severity
  - Number of Casualties / Vehicles
  - Speed Limit
  - Weather Conditions
  - Road Surface Conditions
  - Light Conditions
  - Urban or Rural Area
  - Road Type
  - Vehicle Type
  - Latitude / Longitude

## Key Analyses & Visualizations

- Yearly accident count by season
- Accident distribution by day of week
- Severity breakdown (Fatal / Serious / Slight)
- Impact of weather conditions and road surface
- Speed limit vs accident severity
- Urban vs Rural accident comparison
- Time-of-day / shift patterns
- Heatmap-style seasonal trends over years

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.12
- pandas – data manipulation & cleaning
- matplotlib & seaborn – visualizations
- numpy – numerical operations
